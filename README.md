## Description
As part of this challenge I created a portfolio page which will be leveraged to showcase my work as the course progresses. This will showcase my skills to potential future employees so they can see my live working applications. Having several deployed projects is a monimum requirement to recieve a successful initial interview at many companies. 

This page is built with HTML and CSS at this stage. 

The GitHub repository is found here https://github.com/annalisedev/challengetwo 

Note: Where I do not have applications I have included placeholders linking to my Github.
